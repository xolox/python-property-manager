Useful :class:`property` variants for Python programming.

Introduction
============

The :mod:`property_manager` module defines several :class:`property` variants
that implement Python's `descriptor protocol`_ to provide decorators that turn
methods into computed properties with several additional features.

Custom property types
---------------------

Here's an overview of the predefined property variants and their supported
operations:

==========================  ==========  ============  ==========  =======
Variant                     Assignment  Reassignment  Deletion    Caching
==========================  ==========  ============  ==========  =======
:class:`custom_property`    No          No            No          No
:class:`writable_property`  Yes         Yes           No          No
:class:`mutable_property`   Yes         Yes           Yes         No
:class:`required_property`  Yes         Yes           No          No
:class:`key_property`       Yes         No            No          No
:class:`lazy_property`      No          No            No          Yes
:class:`cached_property`    No          No            Yes         Yes
==========================  ==========  ============  ==========  =======

If you want a different combination of supported options (for example a cached
property that supports assignment) this is also possible, please take a look at
:class:`custom_property.__new__()`.

The following inheritance diagram shows how the predefined :class:`property`
variants relate to each other:

.. inheritance-diagram:: property_manager.custom_property \
                         property_manager.writable_property \
                         property_manager.mutable_property \
                         property_manager.required_property \
                         property_manager.key_property \
                         property_manager.lazy_property \
                         property_manager.cached_property
   :parts: 1

The property manager superclass
-------------------------------

In addition to these :class:`property` variants the :mod:`property_manager`
module also defines a :class:`PropertyManager` class which implements several
related enhancements:

- Keyword arguments to the constructor can be used to set writable properties
  created using any of the :class:`property` variants defined by the
  :mod:`property_manager` module.

- Required properties without an assigned value will cause the constructor
  to raise an appropriate exception (:exc:`~exceptions.TypeError`).

- The :func:`repr()` of :class:`PropertyManager` objects shows the names and
  values of all properties. Individual properties can be omitted from the
  :func:`repr()` output by setting the :attr:`~custom_property.repr` option to
  :data:`False`.

Logging
=======

The :mod:`property_manager` module emits log messages at the custom log level
:data:`~verboselogs.SPAM` which is considered *more* verbose than :mod:`DEBUG
<logging>`, so if you want these messages to be logged make sure they're not
being ignored based on their level.

    The assigned value is stored in the :attr:`~object.__dict__` of the object
    that owns the property.

    :see also: :class:`writable_property`, :class:`mutable_property` and
               :class:`required_property`.

    A relevant note about how Python looks up attributes: When an attribute is
    looked up and exists in an object's :attr:`~object.__dict__` Python ignores
    any property (descriptor) by the same name and immediately returns the
    value that was found in the object's :attr:`~object.__dict__`.

        Constructor for :class:`custom_property` subclasses and instances.

        To construct a subclass:

        :param args: The first positional argument is used as the name of the
                     subclass (defaults to 'customized_property').
        :param options: Each keyword argument gives the name of an option
                        (:attr:`writable`, :attr:`resettable`, :attr:`cached`,
                        :attr:`required`, :attr:`environment_variable`,
                        :attr:`repr`) and the value to use for that option
                        (:data:`True`, :data:`False` or a string).
        :returns: A dynamically constructed subclass of
                  :class:`custom_property` with the given options.

        To construct an instance:

        :param args: The first positional argument is the function that's
                     called to compute the value of the property.
        :returns: A :class:`custom_property` instance corresponding to the
                  class whose constructor was called.

        Here's an example of how the subclass constructor can be used to
        dynamically construct custom properties with specific options:

        .. code-block:: python

           from property_manager import custom_property

           class WritableCachedPropertyDemo(object):

               @custom_property(cached=True, writable=True)
               def customized_test_property(self):
                   return 42

        The example above defines and uses a property whose computed value is
        cached and which supports assignment of new values. The example could
        have been made even simpler:

        .. code-block:: python

           from property_manager import cached_property

           class WritableCachedPropertyDemo(object):

               @cached_property(writable=True)
               def customized_test_property(self):
                   return 42

        Basically you can take any of the custom property classes defined in
        the :mod:`property_manager` module and call the class with keyword
        arguments corresponding to the options you'd like to change.
