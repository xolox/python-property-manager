`Release 1.0`_ (2015-10-04)
---------------------------

The initial commit and release. Relevant notes from the readme:

The `property-manager` package came into existence as a submodule of my
executor_ package where I wanted to define classes with a lot of properties
that had a default value which was computed on demand but also needed to
support assignment to easily override the default value.

Since I created that module I'd wanted to re-use it in a couple of other
projects I was working on, but adding an `executor` dependency just for the
`property_manager` submodule felt kind of ugly.

This is when I decided that it was time for the `property-manager` package to
be created. When I extracted the submodule from `executor` I significantly
changed its implementation (making the code more robust and flexible) and
improved the tests, documentation and coverage in the process.
